##Voyage
Voyage currently has 2 components:
* __Web Server__ is capable of editing and displaying all the stored data as well as scopes you will provide to _Explorer_, through your favorite browser. 
* __Explorer__ searches the web using scopes given through to the _Web Server_ and goes for exploring for you. It will automatically store all relevant informations found on the way, so that you can show all the loot through _Web Server_.

##Requirement

#####[Python 2.7.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/) 
You can check your current version by `python --version`

If the version available through your package mananger is not 2.7.10 or above, you will need to manually build and install 2.7.10. Luckily, there is a tool for doing that.

	curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
	sudo apt-get build-dep python2.7
	pyenv install 2.7.10
	pyenv global 2.7.10
	pip install -U pip

* Download, extract the __master__ then execute on terminal `./InstallScript.sh`
* Set up a mysql server and create a table with the following schema:
```
CREATE DATABASE crawler CHARACTER SET UTF8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
```
(you can replace crawler with another database name if you want). Then put in the database name and credentials in config.yaml

If any problem occurs, please contact one of us on the email address listed above.
